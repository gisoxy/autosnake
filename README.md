The snake eats blocks [T, L, I, O], etc. Its body changes according to the block proportions, and body deformations can catch other blocks.
If the snake fills a straight line of 10 blocks, the line will be removed, and the snake will grow. The snake can use its body length to help complete a line.
The longer the snake, the easier it is to fill a line
